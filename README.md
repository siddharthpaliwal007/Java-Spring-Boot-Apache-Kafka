# Java-Spring-Boot-Apache-Kafka

This is a sample project in which I have used Java Spring Boot Framework with Apache Kafka.

So I have bascially developed a Kafka Producer which is going to read real time streamed data from the WikiMedia. After that it will write the collected data into the Kafka Broker. Then developed a Kafka Consumer for consuming the data from the Broker. And eventually entering the caputured data into the database.
